# Entity Disambiguation: Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Based on our analysis, here's a practical roadmap for extending the entity disambiguation system:

### 1. Generalization Strategy
- **70% of code is reusable** across entity types
- **30% requires customization** via entity handlers
- Configuration-driven approach for maintainability

### 2. Re-ranking Impact
- **10-15ms latency addition** without caching
- **70%+ cache hit rate** expected in production
- **Significant quality improvement** for ambiguous queries

## Quick Wins (Week 1-2)

### 1. Create Base Framework
```python
# generalized_entity_disambiguator.py
class GeneralizedEntityDisambiguator:
    def __init__(self, entity_type: str):
        self.handler = EntityHandlerFactory.create(entity_type)
```

### 2. Implement High-Value Entity Types

**Work Roles** (Highest Impact)
- Most searched in HR/recruiting systems
- Clear ROI from better matching
- Synonym handling critical

**Organizations** (Quick Win)
- Simpler than person names
- High search volume
- Clear exact match patterns

### 3. Configuration System
```yaml
# configs/work_roles.yaml
entity_type: work_role
synonyms:
  - [developer, engineer, programmer]
  - [manager, lead, head]
abbreviations:
  swe: software engineer
  pm: product manager
```

## Medium-Term Goals (Week 3-4)

### 1. Re-ranking Pilot

**Start Small:**
- Only activate for queries with 5+ similar results
- A/B test on 10% of traffic
- Measure quality improvement and latency

**Implementation:**
```python
# Only rerank ambiguous results
if score_variance < 0.01 and len(results) > 5:
    results = reranker.rerank(query, results[:20])
```

### 2. Advanced Entity Types

**Locations:**
- Geocoding integration
- Hierarchy support (city → state → country)
- Proximity scoring

**Departments:**
- Organizational hierarchy
- Common abbreviations (HR, IT, R&D)

## Long-Term Vision (Month 2-3)

### 1. Learning System
- Collect click-through data
- Train custom re-ranker on your data
- Continuous improvement loop

### 2. Multi-Entity Search
- Search across entity types simultaneously
- Cross-entity relationships
- Unified scoring

### 3. Production Optimizations
- GPU batch processing for re-ranking
- Distributed caching
- Real-time index updates

## Implementation Checklist

### Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Extract base classes from current implementation
- [ ] Create `EntityHandler` abstract class
- [ ] Implement `WorkRoleHandler` and `OrganizationHandler`
- [ ] Set up configuration loading
- [ ] Update evaluation framework for multiple entity types

### Week 2: Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Create test suites for each entity type
- [ ] Benchmark performance across entity types
- [ ] Document entity-specific behaviors
- [ ] Create migration guide for existing code

### Week 3: Re-ranking Integration
- [ ] Integrate mxbai-rerank-v2 or similar
- [ ] Implement selective re-ranking logic
- [ ] Add caching layer
- [ ] Create A/B testing framework

### Week 4: Production Readiness
- [ ] Load testing with production volumes
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation and training

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Entity Handler Pattern**
```python
class EntityHandler(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def extract_parts(self, entity: str) -> Dict
    
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_custom_score(self, query: str, entity: str) -> float
```

**Why:** Clean separation of entity-specific logic

### 2. **Two-Stage Architecture**
```
Query → Fast Retrieval (top-20) → Reranking (top-5) → Results
```

**Why:** Balances speed and quality

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement**
```python
# Return fast results immediately
yield quick_results

# Enhance with reranking if beneficial
if should_rerank(quick_results):
    yield reranked_results
```

**Why:** Better user experience

## Performance Targets

### Without Re-ranking
- **Latency:** < 1ms average
- **Throughput:** 5,000+ QPS per instance

### With Re-ranking
- **Latency:** < 5ms average (with 70% cache hits)
- **Throughput:** 200+ QPS per instance
- **Quality:** 20%+ improvement in NDCG

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. **Latency Concerns**
- Start with optional re-ranking
- Heavy caching (70%+ hit rate)
- Progressive loading UI

### 2. **Complexity Management**
- Clear entity handler interfaces
- Extensive testing per entity type
- Gradual rollout

### 3. **Quality Regression**
- A/B testing framework
- Fallback to simple ranking
- User feedback collection

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Generalization)
- Support 3+ entity types
- Maintain < 1ms latency
- 80%+ code reuse

### Phase 2 (Re-ranking)
- 20%+ quality improvement (NDCG)
- < 5ms p95 latency
- 70%+ cache hit rate

### Phase 3 (Production)
- 95%+ availability
- < 10ms p99 latency
- 90%+ user satisfaction

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve design** with stakeholders
2. **Create proof-of-concept** for one new entity type
3. **Benchmark re-ranking** on real queries
4. **Plan phased rollout** starting with low-risk entity types

## Questions to Address

1. Which entity types have highest business value?
2. What's the acceptable latency budget?
3. Do we have training data for custom re-ranker?
4. What's the current search volume per entity type?

## Conclusion

The proposed architecture provides:
- **Flexibility** for new entity types
- **Performance** through selective re-ranking
- **Quality** improvements where needed
- **Maintainability** through clean abstractions

Start with high-value, low-risk implementations and expand based on success metrics.
